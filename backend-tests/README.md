## Quick Start

### Method 1: Using Shell Script (Recommended)
```bash
chmod +x run_tests.sh
./run_tests.sh                              # Test default URL
./run_tests.sh https://your-backend.com     # Test custom URL
```

### Method 2: Direct Python Execution
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 backend_test.py                     # Test default URL
python3 backend_test.py https://custom-url  # Test custom URL
```

## Test Features

### Smart Testing Logic
- Dynamic ID Discovery: Uses real department/service IDs from API responses
- Authentication Flow: Maintains tokens across related tests
- Data Consistency: Reuses NIC/phone data across signup→login→OTP flow
- Graceful Failures: Tests skip when dependencies unavailable

### Sri Lankan Government Context
- NIC Format: {timestamp}V (e.g., 123456789V)
- Phone Format: +94771234567 
- Address Format: {"street": "...", "city": "..."}
- Date Format: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Validation & Security
- Input Validation: Tests invalid data handling
- Authentication: JWT token management
- Authorization: Role-based access testing
- Error Handling: Validates HTTP status codes

## Extending Tests

To add tests for missing routes, extend the BackendTester class:

```python
def test_admin_login(self):
    """Test admin authentication"""
    def check():
        admin_data = {"email": "admin@gov.lk", "password": "password123"}
        response = self.session.post(f"{self.base_url}/api/admin/login", json=admin_data)
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            self.admin_token = data.get('token')
            return True, "Admin authenticated"
        else:
            return response.status_code in [401, 404], f"Status: {response.status_code}"
    
    return self.test("Admin Login", check)
```

## Files

- backend_test.py - Main test script with 13 core tests
- run_tests.sh - Shell script for easy execution  
- requirements.txt - Python dependencies (requests>=2.28.0)
- README.md - This documentation

## Important Notes

1. Admin Routes: Not tested due to requiring SUPER_ADMIN credentials
2. File Operations: Basic file upload/download not tested (requires auth)
3. OTP Testing: Uses dummy OTP "1234" which will fail (expected behavior)
4. Data Validation: Limited to signup validation testing

Current test coverage: 34% (12/35 routes) - Covers all public and basic authenticated routes.
